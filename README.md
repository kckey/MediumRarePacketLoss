## About
This project was built for a hackathon and uses COLMAP to generate detailed 3D terrain maps of disaster zones. Drones capture aerial imagery, processed on a Raspberry Pi prototype (with plans for GPU acceleration), and transmitted via the AT&T network. The goal is to help first responders gain rapid, accurate situational awareness in crisis areas.

## Dependencies
**Hardware**
* [**Raspberry Pi 5**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/): The latest Raspberry Pi model featuring a quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor at 2.4GHz, dual 4Kp60 HDMI outputs, and PCIe Gen 3 support.
* [**Raspberry Pi AI Kit (HAT+) â€“ 26 TOPS**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-kit/): An add-on for the Pi 5 using the Hailo-8 accelerator, delivering up to 26 TOPS for efficient edge AI inference.
